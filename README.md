Section 1

This application is designed to track the details of a variety of events that users are able to add to a table.

Section 2

Currently, the app allows users to add or delete event and add event categories. Users are able to assign events to an event category.

Section 3

In the future, we plan to add a Person class to allow users to create profiles of attendees for events. 
We will need a form to capture the user information, including demographic & contact information. A unique user ID will be assigned for each attendee. 
The person class would have a one to many relationship with the events (as one person may attend as many events as they wish).
